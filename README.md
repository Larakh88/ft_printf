# ft_printf

## Description:
The **'ft_printf'** project at School 42 challenges students to reimplement the standard C function **`printf()`**. This function is a crucial part of C programming, responsible for formatting and printing output to the console. By re-implementing **`printf()`**, I gained a deeper understanding of variadic functions, string manipulation, and formatting techniques.
